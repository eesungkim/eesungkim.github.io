I work as a Machine Learning Developer at [Kakao Enterprise](https://kakaoenterprise.com/) in Korea, after graduating from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Korea with a masterâ€™s degree in speech signal processing. 

I am passionate about making conversational AI with various speech technology and natural language processing applications and developing technologies applicable.

I am a current PhD student at MIT CSAIL working with Antonio Torralba and Phillip Isola. Previously, I worked at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) on PyTorch, and studied computer science and statistics at University of California, Berkeley, where I was fortunate to work with Stuart J. Russell, Ren Ng, and Alexei A. Efros at Berkeley AI Research (BAIR).


Eesung Kim is a research scientist at [Facebook AI Research
(FAIR)](https://kakaoenterprise.com/). His research focuses on
representation learning, self-supervised learning, and structured generative
modeling for unimodal and multimodal speech. He is passionate about reducing
the supervision required for various speech applications and developing
technologies applicable to both written and unwritten languages.
